# Final Project of Introduction to Matlab course

Final Project of the course Introduction to Matlab, taught in UAQ

## Requirement

Build a function `fun` that takes as input two vectors `u` and `v`
and as output provides the vector `w` which contains in each entry
the max between the same entry position of the two vectors.

Download 2 audio signals and load them into Matlab.
Use the function `fun` applied to the first 0.3 seconds of the
*first audio channel* of the 2 signals.
Plot the original 2 audio signals and the one obtained using the
function in a single figure using subplots.

Generate a report in pdf containing the results obtained,
including all the codes created.
